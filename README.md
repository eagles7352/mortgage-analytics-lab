# Mortgage Analytics Lab (Python + SQL + Parquet)

A portfolio-style analytics project built to demonstrate end-to-end skills used in quantitative analytics, pricing, and portfolio monitoring roles — especially in mortgage / insurance / structured products environments.

This repo is intentionally structured like a real analytics “framework”:
- **Python for modeling + automation**
- **SQL for analysis and reporting**
- **Parquet for efficient columnar storage**
- **DuckDB for local analytics database workflows**

## What this project demonstrates

### Recruiter / Hiring Manager highlights
- Loan-level dataset workflows (generate → validate → store → query)
- Reproducible analytics pipeline structure (scripts + modular `src/`)
- SQL-based summarization and monitoring outputs
- Clean dependency management + virtual environment setup
- Version control hygiene (ignoring local DB/data artifacts)

### Technical highlights
- Python 3.13 project with `.venv`
- Libraries: Polars/Pandas, DuckDB, PyArrow/Parquet
- Local database creation and “sanity check” table inserts
- Code organized for easy expansion into cashflow modeling, scenarios, and stress testing
